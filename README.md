# Image_Segmentation_using_K_means_clustering

Image Segmentation: In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. 
The goal of segmenting an image is to change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. 
It is usually used for locating objects and creating boundaries. 

It is not a great idea to process an entire image because many parts in an image may not contain any useful information. 
Therefore, by segmenting the image, we can make use of only the important segments for processing. 

An image is basically a set of given pixels. In image segmentation, pixels which have similar attributes are grouped together. 
Image segmentation creates a pixel-wise mask for objects in an image which gives us a more comprehensive and granular understanding of the object.


# uses

Used in self-driving cars. Autonomous driving is not possible without object detection which involves segmentation.
Used in the healthcare industry. Helpful in segmenting cancer cells and tumours using which their severity can be gauged.
There are many more uses of image segmentation.

In this article, we will perform segmentation on an image of the monarch butterfly using a clustering method called K Means Clustering.
